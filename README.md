# ðŸŽ® Simon Says Game

A web-based version of the classic **Simon Says** memory game! This project challenges players to follow an ever-growing pattern of colors and sounds â€” how long can you keep up?



## ðŸ§  About the Game

This game is a fun way to test your memory and attention skills. Inspired by the popular *Simon Game*, the pattern gets longer each round â€” one mistake and it's game over. Great for learning DOM manipulation and event handling using plain JavaScript.
